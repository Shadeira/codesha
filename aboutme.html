<h3> I received my bachelors degree from Caldwell University May 2017. 
During my years in college I was an ambassador for the campus and earned a certification
for the National Society of Leadership and Success. I enjoy helping out around 
my community and volunteering teaching and helping children. As a very dedicated and motivational
individual, I plan to continue to help educate and mentor children in the future by introducing them
to the world of technology. </font> </h3>Â 

<h2> Comment: </h2>
<p> I have always been very curious. From a young age 
I had the desire to learn and do more. 
I don't believe one thing is for one person, I believe you
should try multiple things until you find your passion and what 
best fits you. You should try something at least once if you dont like it then try something else.
Things you thought you would hate can soon become things you love. 
As a child I would be in the studio with my dad singing on the mic. 
He would always tell me how good I sound but I knew I could sound better.
As a child I was trying and doing new things.
I realized I couldn't find my voice in the studio but 
I hope to find my voice in this big world.</p>
